> Websemble app generator.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-websemble using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-websemble
```

## Getting started

First, create your project folder and cd into it.

```bash
mkdir MyProject
cd MyProject
```

Websemble is meant to work with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), in the future other frameworks. [Create your Bootstrap configuration](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/) and give the generated configuration file
as argument to Websemble. Inside you project directory do the following:

```bash
yo websemble ../path/to/bootstrap/config.json
```

You will be prompted to give your new application details. Choose Bootstrap as
your framework. One the generator is done, execute the following:

```bash
gulp
```

This will compile your application creating a build directory. One this is
done, execute the following:

```bash
cd build
npm start
```

You should see your application running with Electron. To learn more about
Websemble you can visit the [Github repository wiki](https://github.com/cybersettler/websemble/wiki).
